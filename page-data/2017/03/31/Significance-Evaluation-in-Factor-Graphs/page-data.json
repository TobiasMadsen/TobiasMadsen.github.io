Factor graphs are a graphical model formalism capturing both Bayesian Networks and Markov Random Fields and thus covering a very wide range of models.\nOriginally we were led to this question by considering relatively simple first and second order Markov chain models for long DNA motifs, exhibiting dependencies between neighboring bases. Particularly we were looking at the nucleosome binding motif.\nWhile developing our methods a great <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/44/13/6055/2457621/Bayesian-Markov-models-consistently-outperform\">paper</a> on learning these neighbor correlations between bases in motifs in a regularized fashion was published. This makes me quite confident that our methods are relevant to the field.\nWithout further ado - enjoy <a href=\"http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-017-1614-z\">reading</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Significance Evaluation in Factor Graphs","subtitle":null,"date":"Invalid date","description":null,"image":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/automatic_differentiation_in_r/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Automatic Differentiation in R"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/p_values_and_posterior_probabilities/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"P-values and Posterior Probabilities"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"64d89652-efbb-549f-8e0d-a48385d29dc4","previousPostId":"1fa77972-6367-5491-857e-97979ace89b2","nextPostId":"b2dd8217-962c-58e0-a4ee-7a60c0d07554"}},

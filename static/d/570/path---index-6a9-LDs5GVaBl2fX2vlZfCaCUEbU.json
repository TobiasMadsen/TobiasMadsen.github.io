The point made in the post were that the evaluation of the schools relied on so little\ndata, that the payouts would be a lottery. A couple of months ago the result and payout for each school was announced\nfor the first year of the initiative. The ministry claims that 400 students improved their performance as a result of\nthe initiative <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR) had gained access to documents detailing the performance for this year and the\nthree previous years. I asked them to share their data to have a closer look. It turned out that not only had the\nministry not accounted for regression towards the mean, they also only included schools who actually improved not all\nschools in the initiative and they used a regular mean where a weighted mean should have been applied. With these errors\nthe true number of students improved as a result of the initiative is closer to 200 than 400.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> <a href=\"https://uvm.dk/aktuelt/nyheder/uvm/2018/sep/180919-61-skoler-faar-penge-fra-skolepuljen\">The Ministry of Education: 62 skoler får penge fra skolepuljen</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Winning the School Lottery"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}}

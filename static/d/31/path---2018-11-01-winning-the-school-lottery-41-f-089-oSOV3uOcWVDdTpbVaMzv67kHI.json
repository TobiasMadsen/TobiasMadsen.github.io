The point made in the post was that the evaluation of the schools relied on so little\ndata, that the payouts would be a lottery. A couple of months ago the result and payout for each school was announced\nfor the first year of the initiative. The ministry claims that 400 students improved their performance as a result of\nthe initiative <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\nThe 62 schools have on average decreased the proportion of students on that level with almost 14 percentage points \ncompared to their starting points. This amounts to the schools improving more than 400 students.\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR) had gained access to documents detailing the performance for this year and the\nthree previous years, where amongst other things found schools that received the payout but had decreased the general\nperformance <sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>. I asked them to share their data to have a closer look. It turned out that not only had the ministry not\naccounted for regression towards the mean, they also only included schools who actually improved not all schools in the\ninitiative and they used a regular mean where a weighted mean should have been applied. With these errors the true\nnumber of students improved as a result of the initiative is closer to 200 than 400.</p>\n<p>I shared this finding with DR where it was used as part of a larger section on the initiative in their fact-checking\nprogramme “Detektor” the 18th of October <sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>To come up with the figure 400, the ministry only included the schools who got a payout from the initiative. They then\ncomputed the average improvement for these schools and multiplied it onto the total number of students graduating from\nthese schools. By this method they arrived at 405. There are three problems with this method:  </p>\n<ol>\n<li></li>\n<li>A very blunt form of cherry-picking. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>TODO: Share DATA\nTODO: Link to previous post in beginning of story</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p><a href=\"https://uvm.dk/aktuelt/nyheder/uvm/2018/sep/180919-61-skoler-faar-penge-fra-skolepuljen\">The Ministry of Education: 62 skoler får penge fra skolepuljen</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/elever-faar-daarligere-karakterer-men-skolerne-bliver-beloennet-med-8-millioner\">DR: Elever får dårligere karakterer, men skolerne bliver belønnet med 8 millioner kroner</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dr.dk/tv/se/detektor-tv/detektor-10/detektor-2018-10-18\">DR: Detektor 18th October</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Winning the School Lottery","subtitle":"The Danish Ministry of Education has now paid out bonuses to the schools participating in the school initiative.

In order to estimate the chance of the schools making their target by random chance we must account for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean\">regression towards mean</a> (RTM) effect<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>.\nIn short regression towards mean is an effect that dictates that if we have just seen an extreme observation the next observation is more likely to be closer to the average: If you throw a die and it comes up 1, there is a great chance that the next throw will be higher than 1.\nRTM is strongest when the outcome is highly stochastic and the first observation was very extreme.\nFor the schools in the initiative, this means that small schools<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup> and schools with a poor baseline, have the greatest chance of making the target just by chance. </p>\n<p>Without further ado; here is the list of schools and the probability that they will make their target performance by random chance.\nThe expected number of schools that make the target without implementing any changes is 43, without accounting for RTM we would underestimated this number to 29.</p>\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> School </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Approximate number of graduating students </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Percentage of \"weak students\" the last 3 years </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Probability of making the target by chance </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Lindeskovskolen </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 21 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 50 % </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 53.9 % </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Dalmose skole </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 18 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 54 % </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 52.5 % </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Firkløverskolen </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 15 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 33 % </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 51.9 % </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Hanstholm Skole </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 25 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 46 % </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 51.8 % </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Maribo Skole - Borgerskoleafdelingen </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 25 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 46 % </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 51.8 % </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Arenaskolen </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 31 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 62 % </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 51.5 % </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.weekendavisen.dk/2018-30/samfund/karakterer-for-millioner\">Karakterer for millioner</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>The Ministry of Education seems to <a href=\"https://uvm.dk/aktuelt/nyheder/uvm/2017/april/170425-500-mio--kr--til-loeft-af-fagligt-svage-elever\">think</a> that the negation of getting at least 4 in both Danish and Mathematics is getting less than 4 in both Danish and Mathematics.

I recently attended the UseR! conference in [Aalborg](http://user2015.math.aau.dk/).
It was a great conference with great tutorials, good talks and foremost a lot of interesting people.
As I grew up in Aalborg I could not help feeling a bit proud, that the city and the mathematics department pulled this of so brilliantly.
I was lucky enough to get the chance to present my work on the [dgRaph package](http://tobiasmadsen.com/dgRaph/), 
the slides from the presentation can be found [here](/assets/useR2015/useR.html).
